<p>Supervisor: Amal Al-Wahish, PhD<br>
Lecturer, Physics<br>
Research area: Condensed Matter Physics<br>
<a href="mailto:wahish@uw.edu">wahish@uw.edu</a></p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Conducting research at the University of Washington in a group consisting of 6 undergraduate Physics students in the field of Condensed Matter Physics. Research currently is focused on investigations into several phosphates as potential Hydrogen fuel cell storage material. Research is building upon past work by Dr. Al-Wahish. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: background research, data analysis, data interpretation and effective group cooperation, communication and teamwork. Several published papers are expected as a result of this research.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The first part of this internship, Space Weather Forecasting, required a deep knowledge of the subject of space weather. Throughout the 10-week course of this internship, hourly updates were sent during work hours (9-5). These regular updates were important and required great attention to detail. The research portion of this internship involved the assessment of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model (the leading model for the forecasting of CMEs) during an optimal period of observational spacecraft. Various inputs were used for the simulations of 6 different events and simulation results were compared with real-time results. The internship culminated with the presentation of research and results, done through a poster presentation and written paper.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong>  The NCAS internship consisted of two primary phases, the first of which involved a design submission of a new Mars rover. The NCAS team then executed a merit-based selection process in which some interns moved on to the second phase of the program. The second phase was on-location at Ames Research Center and required interns to be put into teams of four, tasked with designing and building a fully-functioning miniature version of the rover. Design engineer involved developing a design for the rover that would function well for the given tasks, and my position as construction engineer required the construction of said design, using available parts and techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Duties as a Geotechnical Assistant at Earth Systems included conducting performing percolation tests designed for the determination of a particular soil’s viability for a variety of uses. Performing multiple percolation tests simultaneously requires speed, precision, accuracy, and great attention to detail. As this was field work, it was essential to write down all data in a clear, legible manner so that it could be easily transcribed at a later time.</p>
